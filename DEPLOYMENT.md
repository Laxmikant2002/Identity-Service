# Deployment Instructions for Render.com

## Prerequisites
- GitHub repository with the latest code (âœ… Done)
- Render.com account (free tier available)

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### 1. Create a New Web Service on Render.com

1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com) and sign up/login
2. Click "New +" and select "Web Service"
3. Connect your GitHub account and select the `Identity-Service` repository
4. Configure the deployment settings:

### 2. Deployment Configuration

**Basic Settings:**
- **Name**: `fluxkart-identity-service` (or your preferred name)
- **Branch**: `main`
- **Root Directory**: (leave empty)
- **Environment**: `Node`
- **Region**: Choose the closest to your users (e.g., Oregon, Frankfurt)

**Build & Deploy Settings:**
- **Build Command**: `npm install` (Render automatically runs postinstall which builds the project)
- **Start Command**: `npm start`

**Environment Variables:**
- `NODE_ENV`: `production`
- `PORT`: (leave empty - Render will set this automatically)

### 3. Advanced Configuration (Optional)

**Instance Type:**
- **Free Tier**: Suitable for development and testing
- **Paid Tier**: For production with guaranteed uptime

**Health Check:**
- **Health Check Path**: `/health`

### 4. Deploy

1. Click "Create Web Service"
2. Render will automatically:
   - Clone your repository
   - Install dependencies (`npm install`)
   - Build the application (`npm run build` via postinstall)
   - Start the service (`npm start`)

### 5. Verify Deployment

Once deployed, your service will be available at:
```
https://fluxkart-identity-service.onrender.com
```
(Replace with your actual service name)

Test the endpoints:
- Health Check: `GET https://your-app.onrender.com/health`
- Identity Service: `POST https://your-app.onrender.com/api/identify`

## Environment Configuration

The app is configured to work out-of-the-box on Render without additional environment variables. It will:
- Use SQLite database (file-based, persisted in the container)
- Automatically bind to the PORT provided by Render
- Run in production mode

## Database Persistence

For production workloads, consider:
1. Using Render's PostgreSQL addon
2. Configuring MySQL via environment variables
3. The SQLite database will persist as long as the container isn't recreated

## Monitoring

Monitor your deployment:
- View logs in Render dashboard
- Check metrics and performance
- Set up alerts for downtime

## Scaling

Render supports:
- Horizontal scaling (multiple instances)
- Auto-scaling based on CPU/memory usage
- Load balancing across instances

## Custom Domain (Optional)

You can configure a custom domain in Render settings after deployment.
